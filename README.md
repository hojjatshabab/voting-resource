## Usage
### Running the Application
After setup, the application is accessible through RESTful endpoints. For example:
- Register users and manage authentication.
- Create voting sessions.
- Allow participants to vote.
- Monitor vote counts in real-time.

### Admin Workflow
1. **Login** as Admin.
2. **Create a Voting Session**: Specify start and end times, candidate options, and other settings.
3. **Monitor Results**: View real-time results.

### User Workflow
1. **Register/Login**.
2. **View Active Voting Sessions**.
3. **Submit Vote**.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                          | Method | Description                         |
